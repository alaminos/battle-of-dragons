# Battle of dragons

Just a silly app you can make for practicing OOP programming with PHP.

# Rough roadmap

+ In coming versions, the dragon objects could be initialised by the web user via a form.
+ A bit of colour and life to the interface wouldn't be a bad idea.
+ Maybe dragons can fall in love and form alliances against more hostile dragons.
