# Battle of dragons

The user create some dragons with a form, then they fight.
Just practicing OOP programming with PHP.

# Rough roadmap

+ ~~In coming versions, the dragon objects could be initialised by the web user via a form~~.
+ A bit of colour and life to the interface wouldn't be a bad idea.
+ Maybe dragons can fall in love and form alliances against more hostile dragons.

# corrections and stuff to add

+ ~~establish const array with values: colors and powers~~
+ ~~define function that picks a random value from the constant at the time of creation of object~~
+ Might be interesting: add a getRandomDamage() function in the class definition, pick a random value but depends partly on the size of the dragon. Plus grand -> plus puissant.
