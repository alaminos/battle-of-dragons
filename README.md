# Battle of dragons

The user create some dragons with a form, then they fight.
Just practicing OOP programming with PHP.

# Rough roadmap

+ ~~In coming versions, the dragon objects could be initialised by the web user via a form~~.
+ A bit of colour and life to the interface wouldn't be a bad idea.
+ Maybe dragons can fall in love and form alliances against more hostile dragons.
